    "\n",
    "Next up: the lobby of a resort on a tropical island. The Historians take a moment to admire the **hexagonal floor tiles** before spreading out.\n",

    "### The Claw Machines\n",
    "\n",
    "The claw machines here are a little unusual:\n",
    "- Instead of a joystick or directional buttons to control the claw, these machines have two buttons labeled **A** and **B**.\n",
    "- Worse, you can't just put in a token and play; it costs:\n",
    "  - **3 tokens** to push the A button.\n",
    "  - **1 token** to push the B button.\n",
    "\n",
    "With some experimentation, you figure out that each machine's buttons are configured to move the claw a specific amount:\n",
    "- **Button A**: Moves the claw a certain number of units to the right (**X axis**) and forward (**Y axis**) with each press.\n",
    "- **Button B**: Moves the claw a different number of units along the same axes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each machine contains **one prize**, and to win the prize:\n",
    "- The claw must be positioned **exactly above the prize** on both the X and Y axes.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Challenge\n",
    "\n",
    "You wonder: **What is the smallest number of tokens you would have to spend to win as many prizes as possible?**\n",
    "\n",
    "You assemble a list of each machine's button behavior and prize location. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Button A: X+94, Y+34\n",
    "Button B: X+22, Y+67\n",
    "Prize: X=8400, Y=5400\n",

    "  - **94 units** along the X axis.\n",
    "  - **34 units** along the Y axis.\n",
    "- Pressing **B** moves the claw:\n",
    "  - **22 units** along the X axis.\n",
    "  - **67 units** along the Y axis.\n",
    "- The prize is located at:\n",
    "  - **X = 8400**.\n",
    "  - **Y = 5400**.\n",
    "\n",
    "To win the prize:\n",
    "- The claw must move exactly **8400 units along the X axis** and **5400 units along the Y axis** from its initial position.\n",
    "\n",
    "The cheapest solution is:\n",
    "- Push the **A button** **80 times**.\n",
    "- Push the **B button** **40 times**.\n",
    "\n",
    "This works because:\n",
    "- For the X axis: \\( 80 * 94 + 40 * 22 = 8400 \\).\n",
    "- For the Y axis: \\( 80 * 34 + 40 * 67 = 5400 \\).\n",
    "\n",
    "The total cost:\n",
    "- \\( 80 * 3 = 240 \\) tokens for the A button.\n",
    "- \\( 40 * 1 = 40 \\) tokens for the B button.\n",
    "- **Total: 280 tokens**.\n",

    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example: Other Claw Machines\n",

    "- **Second Claw Machine**:\n",
    "  - There is no combination of A and B presses that will align the claw with the prize.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Third Claw Machine**:\n",
    "  - The cheapest solution:\n",
    "    - **A button**: 38 presses.\n",
    "    - **B button**: 86 presses.\n",
    "  - Total cost: \\( 38 * 3 + 86 * 1 = 200 \\) tokens.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Fourth Claw Machine**:\n",
    "  - No combination of A and B presses will align the claw with the prize.\n",
