    "# --- Day 11: Plutonian Pebbles ---\n",
    "\n",
    "The ancient civilization on Pluto was known for its ability to manipulate spacetime, and while The Historians explore their infinite corridors, you've noticed a strange set of physics-defying stones.\n",
    "\n",
    "At first glance, they seem like normal stones: they're arranged in a perfectly straight line, and each stone has a number engraved on it.\n",
    "\n",
    "The strange part is that every time you blink, the stones change.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Sometimes, the number engraved on a stone changes.\n",
    "- Other times, a stone might split in two, causing all the other stones to shift over a bit to make room in their perfectly straight line.\n",
    "\n",
    "As you observe them for a while, you find that the stones have a consistent behavior. Every time you blink, the stones each simultaneously change according to the first applicable rule in this list:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **If the stone is engraved with the number `0`, it is replaced by a stone engraved with the number `1`.**\n",
    "2. **If the stone is engraved with a number that has an even number of digits, it is replaced by two stones.**  \n",
    "   The left half of the digits are engraved on the new left stone, and the right half of the digits are engraved on the new right stone.  \n",
    "   *(The new numbers don't keep extra leading zeroes: `1000` would become stones `10` and `0`.)*\n",
    "3. **If none of the other rules apply, the stone is replaced by a new stone; the old stone's number multiplied by `2024` is engraved on the new stone.**\n",
    "\n",
    "No matter how the stones change, their order is preserved, and they stay on their perfectly straight line.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Task\n",
    "\n",
    "How will the stones evolve if you keep blinking at them? You take a note of the number engraved on each stone in the line (your puzzle input).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example\n",
    "\n",
    "If you have an arrangement of five stones engraved with the numbers `0 1 10 99 999` and you blink once, the stones transform as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The first stone, `0`, becomes a stone marked `1`.\n",
    "2. The second stone, `1`, is multiplied by `2024` to become `2024`.\n",
    "3. The third stone, `10`, is split into a stone marked `1` followed by a stone marked `0`.\n",
    "4. The fourth stone, `99`, is split into two stones marked `9`.\n",
    "5. The fifth stone, `999`, is replaced by a stone marked `2021976`.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, after blinking once, your five stones would become an arrangement of seven stones engraved with the numbers:\n",
    "\n",
    "`1 2024 1 0 9 9 2021976`\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is a longer example:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Initial arrangement:**\n",
    "```\n",
    "125 17\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**After 1 blink:**\n",
    "```\n",
    "253000 1 7\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**After 2 blinks:**\n",
    "```\n",
    "253 0 2024 14168\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**After 3 blinks:**\n",
    "```\n",
    "512072 1 20 24 28676032\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**After 4 blinks:**\n",
    "```\n",
    "512 72 2024 2 0 2 4 2867 6032\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**After 5 blinks:**\n",
    "```\n",
    "1036288 7 2 20 24 4048 1 4048 8096 28 67 60 32\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**After 6 blinks:**\n",
    "```\n",
    "2097446912 14168 4048 2 0 2 4 40 48 2024 40 48 80 96 2 8 6 7 6 0 3 2\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, after blinking six times, you would have `22` stones. After blinking `25` times, you would have `55312` stones!\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Puzzle\n",
